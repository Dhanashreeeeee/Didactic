        Jan 19 (Reuters) -

The Kremlin said on Thursday that Ukrainian strikes on Russian-annexed Crimea would be "extremely dangerous", after the New York Times reported that U.S. officials were warming to the idea of helping Kyiv attack the peninsula.

Crimea, which is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, was seized by Moscow and declared annexed in 2014. President Vladimir Putin says the peninsula, like much of the Ukrainian land seized since February, is historically Russian.

        The tournament's fourth seed also converted two of three breakpoint opportunities, while Fernandez capitalized on just one of nine.</p></div>
